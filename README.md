# GW Causal Inference
In this course, I learned how to identify and quantify cause and effect relationships in both experimental and observational data. The material helped me understand the challenges of proving causality, especially in real world settings where randomized experiments arenâ€™t possible. I gained practical statistical tools to make stronger causal claims even with imperfect data.

The course started by reviewing core concepts like linear regression and counterfactual reasoning. Then I studied randomized experiments and how to analyze them properly. Later, I explored advanced techniques for observational data, including propensity scores, matching methods, and sensitivity analysis. The course also introduced instrumental variables and cutting edge developments in causal inference.

By the end, I could confidently assess assumptions needed for causal claims, analyze experimental data, and adjust for biases in observational studies. I now understand how to design research that maximizes credibility when making causal conclusions. These skills are invaluable for my work in data science, policy analysis, and any field where distinguishing causation from correlation matters.

Key terms I mastered include potential outcomes, confounding, propensity score matching, and instrumental variables. The hands on focus gave me tools I can immediately apply in my projects and research.

# Project: Mahalanobis vs. Nearest Neighbor Matching in CVD Risk Analysis

This study investigates the effectiveness of Mahalanobis Distance Matching and Nearest Neighbor Matching in estimating the causal impact of physical activity on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using propensity score matching (PSM). The research leverages a comprehensive dataset of over 70,000 individuals, incorporating variables such as age, gender, biometrics, and lifestyle factors. Logistic regression was employed to estimate propensity scores, followed by PSM to balance covariates between treated (physically active) and control (inactive) groups. Results indicate that Mahalanobis Distance Matching outperforms Nearest Neighbor Matching in high-dimensional datasets, achieving better covariate balance and more precise treatment effect estimates. The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) revealed a significant reduction in CVD risk among active individuals, particularly post-matching. However, residual biases and dataset limitations highlight the need for further refinement. The study underscores the importance of selecting matching methods based on data complexity, offering valuable insights for healthcare applications.
