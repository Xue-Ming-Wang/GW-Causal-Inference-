# Project: Mahalanobis vs. Nearest Neighbor Matching in CVD Risk Analysis

This study investigates the effectiveness of Mahalanobis Distance Matching and Nearest Neighbor Matching in estimating the causal impact of physical activity on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using propensity score matching (PSM). The research leverages a comprehensive dataset of over 70,000 individuals, incorporating variables such as age, gender, biometrics, and lifestyle factors. Logistic regression was employed to estimate propensity scores, followed by PSM to balance covariates between treated (physically active) and control (inactive) groups. Results indicate that Mahalanobis Distance Matching outperforms Nearest Neighbor Matching in high-dimensional datasets, achieving better covariate balance and more precise treatment effect estimates. The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) revealed a significant reduction in CVD risk among active individuals, particularly post-matching. However, residual biases and dataset limitations highlight the need for further refinement. The study underscores the importance of selecting matching methods based on data complexity, offering valuable insights for healthcare applications.
